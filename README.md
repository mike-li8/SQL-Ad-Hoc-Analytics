# SQL-Ad-Hoc-Analytics

## Project Overview
The [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/) [Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance) exhibits a fictional company called AtliQ Technologies. In a previous project, [Power BI Business Insights 360](https://github.com/mike-li8/Power-BI-Business-Insights-360/blob/main/README.md), I built a dashboard that provided insights into various business verticals (finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive).

While the Power BI dashboard answered many common business questions, AtliQâ€™s upper management team now has ten new ad-hoc business questions that cannot be easily addressed by the dashboard. The objective of this project is to use SQL in MySQL to answer these questions and present the insights back to the upper management team in a clear and concise data storytelling format.
