# SQL-Ad-Hoc-Analytics

## Project Overview
The [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/) [Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance) exhibits a fictional company called AtliQ Technologies. AtliQ was rapidly proliferating to various markets around the world. However, AtliQ relied on Excel files for their data analytics needs. Since AtliQ's data was spread across multiple large tables (some containing over a million records), analyzing them in Excel was cumbersome. Moreover, AtliQ frequently encountered technical difficulties using Excel as their primary tool for database. Hence, AtliQ choose **MySQL** as the new relational database management system (RDBMS) becasue it was open-source and powerful.

The objective of this project is to answer ad-hoc business questions by performing analysis in MySQL using SQL:
* User-Defined SQL Functions
* Stored Procedures
* Database Views
* Windows Functions
* Subquery
* CTE (Common Table Expression)
* Temporary Table
